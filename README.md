Task 2: Guessing Game
This task involves creating a simple guessing game using Python. The game generates a random number, and the user is asked to guess the number. Based on the user's input, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low, and continues until the user guesses the correct number.

How the Guessing Game works:
The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program will inform the user if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays the total once the user guesses correctly.
