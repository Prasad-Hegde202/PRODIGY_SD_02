Task 2: Guessing Game
This repository contains a Python program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The user receives feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low, and the game continues until the correct number is guessed.

Features:
Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
Prompts the user to input a guess.
Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
Tracks the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number.
Displays the number of attempts once the game is won.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the Task-2 directory.
Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
Enter your guess when prompted, and continue guessing until you find the correct number.
Example:
If the randomly generated number is 42 and the guesses are:

Input: 50 → Output: Too high, try again.
Input: 30 → Output: Too low, try again.
Input: 42 → Output: Congratulations! You guessed the number 42 in 3 attempts.
Requirements:
Python 3.12.1
